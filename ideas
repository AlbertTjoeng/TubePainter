Maze:
- Tube Blower is a device that invites gamers to play in a completely unprecedented form of interactions. Instead of traditional devices such as keyboards, mouse, joysticks and wii remote controls that challenges gamers on how swift and fluent their fingers are, tube blower challenges gamers to play games using a tube that they will control with their mouth. One of the games that we are implementing is a maze type game. In this game, the user will be presented with a series of randomly auto-generated maze in which the user is required to traverse by directing the tube correctly. Competitive elements could be easily introduced to the game by having multiple users play against each other.
