\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}
In order to measure how interactive our \tube is, we developed our application to be able to take inputs from traditional input devices (\ie mouse and keyboard) and our \tube. For instance, in the shooting game applications the users will be able shoot down the balloons by clicking on the mouse and to match the color of the aballoons with the mouse pointer that the user is controlling, the user will need to press some keys in the keyboard.

After describing to our participants how our \tube works, the participants tried out the applications that we have developed both with and mouse and keyboard and with \tube as the input device.
