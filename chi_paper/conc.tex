\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we have reported on the design and first testing of a tangible user interface that revolves around breathing actions instead of traditional entertainment that utilize pressing keyboard or joysticks. We believe that this invites our users into a realm of interactions that they have not experienced before. The amusement of people who tested our \tube, even in simple games that we developed, have confirmed our success and encouraged us to explore this further.
