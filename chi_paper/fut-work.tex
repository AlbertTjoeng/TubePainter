\section{Future Work}
In the future, we may explore on how well \tube works under group environment. For instance, in the shooting game that we developed, we could extend the game so that two people will compete to get a higher score or collaborate to shoot down a number of balloons under limited time. We believe that our \tube will be much more interactive if this is implemented.

Following up the previous point, making \tube wireless is essential to maximize the user experience. By having a wired system for our \tube, the users will be constrained at how long the wire connecting the tube to the computer is and could not move as freely when using the applications. Under group setting, this problem is exacerbated since multiple users could now collided with each other due to space constraints and this will definitely detriment the user experience.

Instead of utilizing computer screen as the output of our \tube, we believe that it will be best if it is displayed on a standalone screen such as a television screen so that the \tube system will feel more natural to the user and not just "another computer application".

In the hardware side, we also need to smoothen the reading that we get from the accelerometers and gyroscopes
